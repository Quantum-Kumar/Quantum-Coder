# 🧪 Qiskit Global Summer School 2025 – Lab Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **Qiskit Global Summer School (QGSS) 2025** labs, hosted by IBM Quantum. These labs cover a diverse set of topics central to quantum computing, including teleportation, quantum noise mitigation, quantum chemistry simulation, and quantum error correction.

> 🔹 I extracted and submitted only the **exercise-relevant code** from each lab notebook, as part of the QGSS certification process. The solutions are organized by lab and correspond directly to the exercises outlined in the official materials.

All original lab content is publicly available at the [QGSS 2025 GitHub repository](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qgss-2025). My versions focus on the programming challenges from each lab.

> ⚠️ Inline comments and markdown documentation will be added in future updates to enhance clarity and walkthrough value.
